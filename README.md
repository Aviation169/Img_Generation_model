# GAN - Face Generation with PyTorch

This project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) implemented in PyTorch to generate realistic human face images, trained on the CelebA dataset.

**⚠️ Note: This model is intended for experimental and educational purposes only. For production or real-time applications, extensive training, fine-tuning, and performance optimization are required.**

## 🧠 Models

- **Generator**: Takes in a 100-dimensional random noise vector and generates 64x64 RGB face images.
- **Discriminator**: A CNN that classifies real vs fake images and helps the generator improve.

## 🔧 Requirements

Install required packages (use `%pip install` if running in a notebook):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib gdown
```

## 📦 Dataset

This project uses the CelebA dataset.
To download and extract it:

Visit the official site or use gdown for direct downloads (if you have a link).

Place all aligned face images inside `img-align-celeba/` directory.

```
img-align-celeba/
└──celebA/
    ├── 000001.jpg
    ├── 000002.jpg
    └── ...
```

## 🚀 Training

- Open the Jupyter Notebook celeba_gan.ipynb and run the cells step by step.

- The generator and discriminator are trained using the Binary Cross-Entropy Loss.

- The generator learns to create realistic faces from random noise.

- The discriminator learns to distinguish real CelebA images from fake ones generated by the generator.

## 🖼️ Output

- Face images are generated every few epochs and saved as `celeba_epoch_X.png`

- Loss values for both networks are plotted and saved as `celeba_loss.png`

## 💡 Tips

- Training GANs can be unstable. Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, or adding gradient penalty.

- Try increasing resolution (128x128) or using a progressive GAN setup.
